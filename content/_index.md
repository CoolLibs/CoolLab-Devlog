Welcome to **Cool Lab** ðŸ¥³

[**Cool**](https://github.com/CoolLibs) is an open-source C++ framework designed for image-oriented software.

It is built on top of other amazing open-source projects like __*glfw*__, __*Dear ImGui*__, __*glm*__, __*spdlog*__, __*cereal*__, __*stb*__,  __*boxer*__, __*nfd*__ and many more.

[**Cool Lab**](https://github.com/CoolLibs/CoolLab) is a patchwork of creative tools based on Cool. It is mainly focused on image and video generation, and includes some audio as well.

This devlog is here to document our process and thoughts as we build these tools, as well as all the crazy (good) ideas that we have and might want to implement one day ðŸ˜‡

If you wish to contribute to the project, you might want to take a look at the [Dev Guide](./dev-guide).

If you want to use the project, take a look at the [User Guide](./user-guide).
