Welcome to **Cool Lab** ðŸ¥³

**Cool** is an ecosystem of open-source libraries built with quality and modularity in mind
https://github.com/CoolLibs

**Cool Lab** is a patchwork of creative tools based on Cool. We are mainly focused on image and video generation
https://github.com/CoolLibs/CoolLab

This devlog is here to document our process and thoughts as we build these tools, as well as all the crazy (good) ideas that we have and might want to implement one day ðŸ˜‡
