Welcome to **Cool Lab** ðŸ¥³

[**Cool**](https://github.com/CoolLibs) is an ecosystem of open-source libraries built with quality and modularity in mind.

It is built on top of other amazing libraries like __*glfw*__, __*Dear ImGui*__, __*glm*__, __*spdlog*__, __*cereal*__, __*stb*__,  __*boxer*__, __*nfd*__ and many more.

[**Cool Lab**](https://github.com/CoolLibs/CoolLab) is a patchwork of creative tools based on Cool. It is mainly focused on image and video generation, and includes some audio as well.

This devlog is here to document our process and thoughts as we build these tools, as well as all the crazy (good) ideas that we have and might want to implement one day ðŸ˜‡

If you want to contribute to the project, you might want to take a look at the [Getting Started](./getting-started) section.
