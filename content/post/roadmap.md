## Layer system

How do we combine the outputs from our different system / from different instances of the same system.
Do we use a classic layer structure, or a graph ?

## Audio

Import audio files and play them along the image generation (ideal to produce audio clips). Retrieve data from the audio to drive the images (pitch, bpm, volume etc.)

## Parameter system

Data usable across the different systems.

## Simple compute shaders
